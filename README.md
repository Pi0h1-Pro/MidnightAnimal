- The final public build of The Document of Midnight Animal, released on itch.io on 14 December 2017
- The full source code of the The Document of Midnight Animal, last edited some time in the summer of 2018

The Document of Midnight Animal was a standalone modification for the Hotline Miami mod Midnight Animal that was discontinued in the spring of 2018. Its primary purpose was to serve as an open-ended platform for me to experiment with a bunch of different gameplay ideas and proofs-of-concept that I found interesting or worth exploring. 

It was originally intended to be released on a rolling schedule, with builds being made publicly available as I finished up batches of content. 

My decision to discontinue it was based on a twofold motivation: the first, being that I was no longer interested in working on an action game at that point, and the second, being that I felt the effort of trying to justify its existence in the public fallout of its foundational version (the titular Midnight Animal) was no longer warranted.

The source code included with this release does not contain my most recent edits to the game, but it is the most stable release (which itself is saying a lot, given how buggy it is, and how incomplete many features are). It was build in Gamemaker Studio 1.4, which has now been officially discontinued, but remains usable in version 1.4.9999. I'm not sure how difficult it would be to import this into any newer versions of Gamemaker, and will not provide any assistance for those who endeavour towards such an end.

I bear no further responsibility following the release of these files to the stability or soundness of anything contained within, or any decisions I made at the time regarding any particular piece of content or design. I will not (and frankly cannot, given how long it's been since I've worked on this) provide any further support for it at all.

Otherwise, feel free to do whatever you want with this as you see fit. I hope that it may still be able to be of some use or inspiration after all these years, in whatever way or form that may take.
