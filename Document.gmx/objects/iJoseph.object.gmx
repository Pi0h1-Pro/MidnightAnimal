They are widely regarded as some of the most fearsome and capable warriors in all the lands, handpicked by the Empress herself. During peacetime, they serve a wide variety of civil duties, and are often responsible for handling sensitive diplomatic and investigative situations.",

    "Growing up as the son of an upper-class Carcosan family with no military history, Thomas never really cared much for his future, always assuming he'd naturally end up in his family's business as bankers anyways; and consequently spent most of his childhood in a reckless and carefree manner, getting into fights and climbing buildings. His numerous accomplishments as a pugilist earned him a near-expulsion which resulted in him being sent away to a foreign school of economics, where he demonstrated a surprisingly degree of skill particularly in securities. Following his graduation, he became a risk analyst for a private overseas subsidiary of the Imperial Bank, where he achieved a reputation as a highly respectable analyst with a keen sense for the moods of the market. Not long afterwards, however, he found himself once again bored and unsatisfied with his job; and decided to return home to Carcosa in order to seek employment with the Empire. As luck would have it, he discovered he'd arrived just in time for the beginning of the Struggles. Figuring he had nothing better to do anyways, and that the Empire was already at war, he decided he might as well just enlist after all.
    
    Thomas's amiable and easy-going manner conceal an uncanny eye for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in technical and human systems alike.  A master tactician and strategist, he served for several years as a trapper at the end of the Third Inquisition, responsible for hunting down and capturing rogue elements. As a recognition of his extraordinary success and skill, he was recently appointed to the role of Court Intelligencer, where he serves as the chief security advisor to the Throne, uncovering conspiracies and aiding in investigations. He possesses a knack for being able to foresee, thwart and subvert even the most highly complex and byzantine threats.
    
    A highly accomplished practitioner of the System, the Empire's official unarmed combat protocol, Thomas is said to be undefeated in one-on-one fights, and is widely regarded as one of the most formidable opponents one can face in close-quarters combat. He is one of only three known living individuals who possess the ability to channel the Dim Mak, a legendary technique passed down from ancient disciplines that is rumoured to be able to kill any opponent upon contact. To the relief and humour of all those around him — including himself — despite his unparalleled skills as a martial artist, his performance on the range leaves much to be desired.")
